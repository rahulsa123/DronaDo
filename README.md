Minor Project (Online Tutor Spotter)

#OBJECTIVE: 

To connect the students to the best tutors nearby and let them get best possible knowledge. Parents can even keep the track of coaching class.  Secondary aim for many people having knowledge is to earn money by giving tuition classes to the students. 
 
#BRIEF OVERVIEW:
DronaDo is a web project where parents/students can find an exceptional one-on-one tutor near them. It takes just seconds and it's free to contact them. They can select a tutor like by location, subject, experience, price, and rating. Then contact the tutor directly by filling out the form on their profile page and then respond according to the reply from the tutor.              
They may want to contact several tutors to find the right one for them. They can handle all scheduling and payment directly with the tutor, we'll stay out of their way. They can login to their account at any time to view the tutors they've worked with and rate them. An account will be created for them automatically after they contact their first tutor. 
 
DronaDo is also a great way for tutors to find people who are interested in hiring them for tutoring jobs and make some extra money! Tutoring is one of the most lucrative and rewarding part-time jobs out there, and we are really excited to provide a website where so many people can connect with each other. We really believe that this is the future of the tutoring industry (people connecting online) and we would love to have them join us!
